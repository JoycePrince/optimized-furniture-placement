# optimized-furniture-placement
This project builds an AI model to predict optimal furniture placement in 2D room layouts based on room size and furniture count. A Random Forest Regressor predicts coordinates for sofas, tables, and beds. Deployed via a Flask REST API, it allows user inputs and includes a visualization for layout representation.
